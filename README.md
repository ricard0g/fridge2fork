# Marti Meals App

This is a simple project created as a gift for my girlfriend where she is able to find new recipes either based on the ingredient or completely random.

## Features

The user can: 

- Search recipes _by ingredient_
- Search recipes _randomly_
- Once he gets the recipe he can go back and forward to get more recipes
- He can go directly to a more detailed page of the full recipe
- He's able to see a **YouTube video** where the recipe preparation is recorded

These two functionalities are thanks to [themealdb](https://www.themealdb.com/) API.

## Tech Used

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
